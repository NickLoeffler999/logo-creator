## Description

## Installation

The first thing you'll want to do is clone the repo, and then open it in your favorite code editor. Using the terminal, install inquirer@v8.2.4, and Node.js if you haven't already. Run npm i to install them. Type Node into the command line after all previous steps are completed to run the application.

## Usage

To run this application, use the CLI to navigate to the directory where you have it installed on your machine. Run npm i to install the dependencies, and then run node index.js. There will be a few questions/prompts to answer, which will eventually create your new logo. When all of the questions are answered, you will find the logo has been generated into the made-it/index.html file.
